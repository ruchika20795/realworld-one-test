# Intro
I have used create-react-app to create this project. I have integrated styled-components for CSS. I have added react-router-dom for adding routes.

## About
This app contains 3 pages. First is Home page accessoble at default route. Second is Data page which makes the api call to fetch data and shows it in Grid/Tabular form based on View selection radio buttons. Third page shows the performance data collected with the help of React Profiler API for Data component.
## To run this in your local:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
